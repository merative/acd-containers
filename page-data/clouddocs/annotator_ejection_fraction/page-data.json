The smallest possible start position is 0. |\n| end | The end position of the annotation as character offset into the text. The end position points at the first character after the annotation, such that end-begin equals the length of the coveredText. |\n| coveredText | The text covered by an annotation as a string. |\n| type | aci.EjectionFractionInd |\n| firstValue | The first value of percentage.  For example, in the text “echocardiogram demonstrated ejection fraction of 30 to 35%”, the firstValue is 30. |\n| secondValue | The second value of percentage.  For example, in the text “echocardiogram demonstrated ejection fraction of 30 to 35%”, the secondValue is 35.  If the value is not specified as a range then the value of this feature is not retuned. |\n| isRange | Determines if the ejection fraction phrase contains a range of values.  For example, in the text “echocardiogram demonstrated ejection fraction of 30 to 35%”, the isRange is true. |\n| measurementMethod | Method by which the Ejection/Fraction percentage or ratio is measured.  The measurementMethod will be `echo` if the method by which the ejection fraction was take was an echocardiogram, otherwise, the measurementMethod  feature will not be present. |\n| efAlphabeticValueNormalizedName | Normalized name for the appliied value that is word form. |\n| efAlphabeticValueSurfaceForm | Covered text that represents applied value in word form.   For example, in the text `EF was severely depressed at 28%`, the efAlphabeticValueSurfaceForm is `severely depressed`.  Examples include:   `low`, `normal`,`reduced`, and `improvement`. |\n| efTermNormalizedName | Normalized name for ejection fraction.   For example, in the text `Echocardiogram at the outside hospital demonstrated EF of approximately 60%`, the efTermNormalizedName is `ejection fraction`. |\n| efTermSurfaceForm | Covered text that represents the ejection fraction.   For example, in the text `Echocardiogram at the outside hospital demonstrated EF of approximately 60%`, the efTermSurfaceForm is `EF`.  Examples include:  `EF`, `LVEF`, `left ventricular ejection fraction`, `RVEF`,  and `ejection fraction`. |\n| efSuffixSurfaceForm | Covered text that represents the suffix to the measurement.  For example, in the text `Echocardiogram demonstrated EF of approximately 60%`, the efSuffixSurfaceForm is `%`.  Examples include: `%`, `percent`,  and `percentile`, |\n| efSuffixNormalizedName | Normalized name for suffix measurement fraction. |\n| echocardiogramNormalizedName | The normalized name for the echocardiogram. |\n| echocardiogramSurfaceForm | Covered text that represents the echocardiogram.  Examples include:   `echo`, `echocardiogram`, and  \"echocardiographic\". |\n\n### Sample Response\n\nSample response from the ejection fraction annotator for the text: `ejection fraction of 10 - 25 percent by echocardiogram`\n\n```\n\"EjectionFractionInd\": [\n          {\n            \"type\": \"aci.EjectionFractionInd\",\n            \"begin\": 0,\n            \"end\": 54,\n            \"coveredText\": \"ejection fraction of 10 - 25 percent by echocardiogram\",\n            \"hypothetical\": false,\n            \"firstValue\": \"10\",\n            \"secondValue\": \"25\",\n            \"efTermSurfaceForm\": \"ejection fraction\",\n            \"efSuffixSurfaceForm\": \"percent\",\n            \"efSuffixNormalizedName\": \"percent\",\n            \"echocardiogramNormalizedName\": \"echocardiogram\",\n            \"efTermNormalizedName\": \"ejection fraction\",\n            \"echocardiogramSurfaceForm\": \"echocardiogram\",\n            \"measurementMethod\": \"echo\",\n            \"isRange\": \"true\"\n          }\n        ]\n```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"5f4e21c50e07750217bb6faf730a7a6e","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":192},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ejection Fraction","excerpt":".","categories":"Annotators","slug":"annotator_ejection_fraction","toc":true},"excerpt":".","exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Ejection Fraction\"\nexcerpt: \".\"\ncategories: Annotators\nslug: annotator_ejection_fraction\ntoc: true\n---\n<!--                                                                    -->\n<!-- (C) Copyright Merative US L.P. and others 2011, 2023                -->\n<!--                                                                    -->\n<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0                                -->\n<!--                                                                    -->\n\n<!-- # Ejection Fraction (Deprecated) -->\n\nThe purpose of the Ejection Fraction annotator is to annotate ejection fraction test results.
