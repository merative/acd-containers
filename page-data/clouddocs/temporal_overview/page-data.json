The smallest possible start position is 0. |\n| end | The end position of the temporal entity as a character offset into the text. The end position points at the first character after the annotation, such that end-begin equals the length of the coveredText. |\n| temportalType | Provides information about the type of a temporal entity.

For example, in the image above _2/10_ in the context of the patient's current pain level scores low as a date and is not surfaced. |\n| relationType | Provides information about how the temporal entity relates to an entity.
