As newer versions of UMLS are made available in the service, `umls.latest` library configurations will automatically leverage the latest available version of UMLS in the service once available. Declaration of a specific version of UMLS is recommended to avoid undesirable changes in output as newer versions of UMLS are made available within the service. Through declaration of a specific version of UMLS, newer versions of UMLS may be evaluated prior to use in production.\n\n### Annotation Types\n\n* aci.AllergyMedicationInd\n* aci.AllergyInd\n\n#### aci.AllergyInd\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|:--------|-------------|\n| begin | The start position of the annotation as a character offset into the text.
