For example, a patient's discharge summary may contain a <q>Family History</q> section identifying medical diagnoses of the patient's parents. In some instances, this information may not be relevant for a particular use case. Using the section annotator, annotations identified as belonging to the <q>Family History</q> section may be filtered out.\n\nThe section annotator provides a set of predefined section titles based on the [Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)](https://loinc.org/) vocabulary. In addition to the predefined section titles, section headings are also identified based on a few simple formatting rules:\n\n1. If a heading is in all uppercase letters followed by a \":\", such as \"VACCINES:\", the heading will be treated as a section header.\n2. If a section title is followed or preceded by all uppercase letters (with \"/\" in between), both the section title and the uppercase portion is considered the section header. If uppercase letters follow the dictionary entry, the uppercase portion may include parentheses. Examples include \"RELEVANT/FamilyHistory:\" and \"Family History/(RELEVANT):\".\n3. By default, a section will only be identified if the section title starts at the beginning of a line. To identify sections when the title appears later in the text, use the **sections_can_start_anywhere** configuration parameter.\n\nA section includes all the text between two section headings. Annotations that exist within the section will be annotated with  the section information in the **sectionNormalizedName** and **sectionSurfaceForm<** fields.\n\n## Configurations\n\n| Configuration | Values | Description |\n|:--------------|:-------|:------------|\n| include_covered\\_text | true/false | When true, the coveredText feature for the section annotation is returned. When false _(default)_, the coveredText feature is not returned. |\n| turn_off_internal\\_triggers | true/false | When true, the predefined section titles are not used.
