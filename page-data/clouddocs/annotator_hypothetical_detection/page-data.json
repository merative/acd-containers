For example, a patient's record may include the statement `The doctor discussed the benefits of having an MRI performed`. It would be incorrect to say the patient has had an MRI since the sentence indicates the patient and doctor only talked about having an MRI. This statement would be identified as a hypothetical statement.  Another example could be `the patient's father had diabetes`. This isn't stating the patient has diabetes, just that his father did have it.  This is an example of a family history hypothetical span.\n\nThe hypothetical annotator makes use of words or phrases called triggers. When a trigger is found in text, the associated phrase is tagged as being a hypothetical span. In the two examples, the trigger terms are `discussed` and `father`.  Internal to the hypothetical annotator are two dictionaries of these trigger words: hypothetical triggers and family history triggers. Examples from the hypothetical triggers dictionary include `suspected`, `talked about`, and `scheduled for`. Likewise, the internal family history triggers dictionary contains familial terms such as `sister`, `mother`, `brother`, etc.\n\nThe hypothetical annotator will add a *hypothetical* field (`true|false`) to annotations that are part of a hypothetical span.  When *hypothetical* is `true`, a *hypotheticalType* field will also be added to indicate the kind of hypothetical span.\n\nThe hypothetical annotator should run after all other annotators to ensure hypothetical fields are created correctly for each annotation.\n\n## Annotation Types\n\n* HypotheticalSpan\n\n## Configurations\n\n| Configuration | Values | Description|\n|:--------------|:-------|:-----------|\n| remove_hypothetical | true/false | When true, any medical concepts deemed hypothetical from the surrounding context will be removed from the API response.

When false (*default*), family history annotations will not be included in the response. For example, `his father has diabetes` will be annotated and included in the hypothetical span in the response when true. |\n\n## HypotheticalSpan\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|:--------|:------------|\n| begin | The start position of the annotation as a character offset into the text.
