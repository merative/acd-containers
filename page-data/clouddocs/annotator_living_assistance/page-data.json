There are six living assistance annotators that cover different types of assistance needs:  Bathing, dressing, eating, seeing, toileting, and walking.\n\n## Bathing Assistance\n\nThis daily living activities annotator identifies text that indicates whether a patient needs any type of assistance while bathing or taking shower. Additionally, the annotator will also identify patients who potentially needing help if the text mentions patient is having difficulty with a specific bathing task such as needing help washing feet.\n\n### Configurations\n\n| Configuration | Values | Description |\n|:--------------|--------|-------------|\n| Library | <ul><li>umls.latest</li><li>umls.2021AA</li><li>umls.2020AA</li><li>umls.2019AA <i>(deprecated - will be removed in 2022)</i></li></ul> | Defines the version of the UMLS library that is used when analyzing unstructured data. |\n\nThe value `umls.latest` will reference the latest available version of UMLS within the service.

As newer versions of UMLS are made available in the service, `umls.latest` library configurations will automatically leverage the latest available version of UMLS in the service once available. Declaration of a specific version of UMLS is recommended to avoid undesirable changes in output as newer versions of UMLS are made available within the service. Through declaration of a specific version of UMLS, newer versions of UMLS may be evaluated prior to use in production.\n\n#### Annotation Types\n\n* aci.SeeingAssistanceInd\n\n### aci.SeeingAssistanceInd\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|:--------|-------------|\n| begin | The start position of the annotation as a character offset into the text.
