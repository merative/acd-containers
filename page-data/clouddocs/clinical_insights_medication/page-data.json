Those linkages are added as _associatedAdverseEvents_ in the _modifiers_ list. An example is shown below.\n\n### Sample Response\n\nConsider the following sample text.\n\n_If she is able to get her fasting blood glucose down, we may be able to take her off of Metformin._\n\nThe clinical insight features for Metformin might look as follows:\n\n```\n\"insightModelData\": {\n\t\"medication\": {\n\t\t\"usage\": {\n\t\t\t\"takenScore\": 1,\n\t\t\t\"consideringScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"discussedScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"labMeasurementScore\": 0\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"startedEvent\": {\n\t\t\t\"score\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"usage\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"explicitScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\t\"consideringScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\t\"discussedScore\": 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"stoppedEvent\": {\n\t\t\t\"score\": 1,\n\t\t\t\"usage\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"explicitScore\": 0.126,\n\t\t\t\t\"consideringScore\": 0.874,\n\t\t\t\t\"discussedScore\": 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"doseChangedEvent\": {\n\t\t\t\"score\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"usage\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"explicitScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\t\"consideringScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\t\"discussedScore\": 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"adverseEvent\": {\n\t\t\t\"score\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"allergyScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\"usage\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"explicitScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\t\"consideringScore\": 0,\n\t\t\t\t\"discussedScore\": 0\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nExample of _associatedAdverseEvents_: if an adverse event is detected, the adverse event link model will create linkages to the diagnoses or abnormal findings involved as appropriate.
