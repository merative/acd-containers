The version that ships with Annotator for Clinical Data covers approximately 2 million concepts.  The breadth of this information is useful to explore a new medical domain, but it can also create false annotations over spans of text.  Consider a simple acronym like _TEC_.  In a recent version of UMLS, TEC is annotated with nine concepts, that represent seven different ideas - Thymic epithelial cell, Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood, Transluminal extraction catheter, TEC gene/protein, NR4A3 wt Allele, Tubingen electric campimetry, and RHBDF2 wt Allele.  Collisions like this are not uncommon in UMLS.\n\nThe Concept Disambiguation annotator ranks the contextual validity of a UMLS [concept](/clouddocs/annotator_concept_detection/) based on sentence and document level information.  It can act on any annotation with a UMLS CUI.\n\nIf your use case requires you to handle a broad range of medical topics and concept level precision is important, adding disambiguation to your Annotator for Clinical Data flow can help.  Conversely, if you work with a relatively small set of concepts or you only use complex derived  [attributes](/clouddocs/annotator_attribute_detection/), disambiguation may not be necessary.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe disambiguation annotator can be configured to remove annotations it determines are invalid or to tag them as invalid but leave them in the API response.\n\n| Configuration | Values | Description |\n|:--------------|:-------|:------------|\n| remove_invalid | true/false | When true, any concepts that disambiguation determines to be invalid will be removed from the API response.  When false <i>(default)</i>, concepts will contain a _validity_ field with the value INVALID, VALID, or NO_DECISION but will be preserved in the API response. |\n\n### Sample Response\n\nIn this example, TEC refers to _thymic epithelial cell_ in the source document.  Notice the **disambiguationData** section contains a field with the judgement.  If **remove_invalid** is set to `true`, the invalid concepts will not be returned in the response.\n\n```\n{\n    \"cui\": \"C0229951\",\n    \"preferredName\": \"Thymic epithelial cell\",\n    \"semanticType\": \"cell\",\n    \"source\": \"umls\",\n    \"sourceVersion\": \"2018AA\",\n    \"type\": \"umls.Cell\",\n    \"begin\": 19,\n    \"end\": 22,\n    \"coveredText\": \"TEC\",\n    \"nciCode\": \"C33771\",\n    \"disambiguationData\": {\n        \"validity\": \"VALID\"\n    },\n    \"snomedConceptId\": \"81596002\",\n    \"vocabs\": \"MTH,NCI,UWDA,SNOMEDCT_US,FMA\"\n}\n...\n{\n    \"cui\": \"C0238478\",\n    \"preferredName\": \"Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood\",\n    \"semanticType\": \"dsyn\",\n    \"source\": \"umls\",\n    \"sourceVersion\": \"2018AA\",\n    \"type\": \"umls.DiseaseOrSyndrome\",\n    \"begin\": 19,\n    \"end\": 22,\n    \"coveredText\": \"TEC\",\n    \"icd9Code\": \"284.89\",\n    \"icd10Code\": \"D60.1\",\n    \"nciCode\": \"C131683\",\n    \"disambiguationData\": {\n      \"validity\": \"INVALID\"\n    },\n    \"snomedConceptId\": \"234375006\",\n    \"meshId\": \"M0531441\",\n      \"vocabs\": \"MTH,NCI_NICHD,MSH,NCI,OMIM,SNOMEDCT_US,DXP\"\n}\n```\n\n### Dependencies\n\nDisambiguation only operates on UMLS concepts.
