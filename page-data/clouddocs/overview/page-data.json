Please contact your IBM sales representative for details.\n\nThe Annotator for Clinical Data Service is designed to find medical concepts, [medical codes](/clouddocs/medical_codes/), and contextual information in unstructured text. It provides turn key annotators as well as highly customizable annotators that you can tune specifically for your application needs.  The Unified Medical Language System ([UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) is the primary source for concepts and medical codes. Annotator for Clinical Data Service can also work with user provided ontologies beyond UMLS.  \n\nTo illustrate the basic function of Annotator for Clinical Data Service, let's look at a simple example.  Imagine that we have the following small snippet of text:\n\n```\nThere were no signs of ulceration\n```\n\nThe resulting concept over ulceration will contain medical codes along with contextual information about the concept - in this example, the concept is negated.\n\n```\n{\n    \"cui\": \"C3887532\",\n    \"preferredName\": \"Ulceration\",\n    \"semanticType\": \"patf\",\n    \"source\": \"umls\",\n    \"sourceVersion\": \"2018AA\",\n    \"type\": \"umls.PathologicFunction\",\n    \"begin\": 23,\n    \"end\": 33,\n    \"coveredText\": \"ulceration\",\n    \"negated\": true,\n    \"nciCode\": \"C25757\",\n    \"snomedConceptId\": \"263913002\",\n    \"vocabs\": \"MTH,NCI_CDISC,NCI_FDA,NCI,OMIM,SNOMEDCT_US,NCI_NCI-GLOSS\"\n}\n```\n\n## Data Isolation\n\n### Public Multi-tenant Instances\n\n**User Configuration Data:** User configuration data is stored in Cloud Object Storage. This data is isolated by tenant at the service layer.\n\n**User Unstructured Text:** Requested analysis of unstructured text is processed in-memory. The input text is not persisted. Requests are isolated at the service layer.\n\n### Dedicated Instances\n\n**User Configuration Data:** User configuration data is stored in Cloud Object Storage. This data is isolated at the service layer.\n\n**User Unstructured Text:** Requested analysis of unstructured text is processed in-memory. The input text is not persisted. Requests are isolated at the Kubernetes pod layer.\n\n## Compute Isolation\n\n**Public Multi-tenant Instances:** the service is accessed via public endpoints. The service will access all dependencies via private endpoints. In these instances the control plane of the service is shared across tenants.\n\n**Dedicated Instances:** the service can be accessed via public and/or private endpoints. Review [Public and private network endpoints](/about/overview/) for details. The service will access all dependencies via private endpoints. In these instances the control plane of the service is isolated in separate pods for each tenant.\n\n## Available Annotators\n\nThe following annotators are available for detecting and coding medical concepts within unstructured data.\n\n### Attributes\n\nAttributes are higher order concepts composed of multiple pieces of information found in a document.  An example of this might be understanding if a patient is overweight or not.  Given some example text, we would like to know if the patient is overweight or not.\n\n```\nThe patient is a 37 year old male who is 6 feet tall and weighs 170 lbs.\n```\n\nYou can create custom [concept values](/clouddocs/annotator_concept_value/) to extract and normalize the patient's height and weight.  With that information, you can create inference rules in IBM Clinical Data Annotator to combine that information into a single attribute that we'll call `NORMAL_WEIGHT`.  Custom attributes like this are a powerful way to distill unstructured text into actionable insights.\n\nFor more information, see [Attributes](/clouddocs/annotator_attribute_detection/).\n\n### Concepts\n\nThe concept annotator finds UMLS or custom concepts in unstructured text.\n\nFor more information, see [Concepts](/clouddocs/annotator_concept_detection/).\n\n### Concept Value\n\nThe concept value annotator creates composite attributes resulting from a medical concept and an associated value.  It supports scalar values as well as value ranges.  \n\n```\nThe patient is a 37 year old male who is 6 feet tall and weighs 170 lbs.\n```\n\nIn this example, the combination of `height` with `6 feet` is an example of how concept values work.\n\nFor more information, see [Concept Value](/clouddocs/annotator_concept_value/).\n\n## Contextual Annotators\n\nContextual annotators use the surrounding context of the document to provide a deeper understanding of concepts.\n\n### Negation\n\nIdentifies spans of text with an implied negative meaning.  For example: _There were no signs of ulceration._\n\nFor more information, see [Negation](/clouddocs/annotator_negation_detection/).\n\n### Hypothetical\n\nIdentifies spans of text are the object of a hypothetical statement.  For example: _We discussed the pros and cons of chemotherapy._\n\nFor more information, see [Hypothetical](/clouddocs/annotator_hypothetical_detection/).\n\n### Concept Disambiguation\n\nDetermines the validity of UMLS concepts detected in a document.\n\nFor more information, see [Disambiguation](/clouddocs/annotator_concept_disambiguation/).\n\n### Spell Check\n\nMedically aware spell checker that can be integrated into an API call.\n\nFor more information, see [Spell Check](/clouddocs/annotator_spell_check/).\n\n### Turn Key Annotators\n\n Annotator for Clinical Data provides a set of prebuilt annotators targeted at specific medical domains.\n\n* [Allergy](/clouddocs/annotator_allergy/) _(deprecated)_\n* [Cancer](/clouddocs/annotator_cancer/) _(deprecated)_\n* [Ejection Fraction](/clouddocs/annotator_ejection_fraction/) _(deprecated)_\n* [Lab Values](/clouddocs/annotator_lab_values)\n* [Living Assistance](/clouddocs/annotator_living_assistance/) _(deprecated)_\n* [Medications](/clouddocs/annotator_medication/)\n* [Named Entities](/clouddocs/annotator_named_entities/)\n* [Procedures](/clouddocs/annotator_procedure/)\n* [Sections](/clouddocs/annotator_sections/)\n* [Smoking](/clouddocs/annotator_smoking/) _(deprecated)_\n* [Symptoms & Diseases](/clouddocs/annotator_symptom_disease/)\n\n### Clinical Insights\n\nClinical insights are a collection of models and cartridge configuration that provide contextual information about key clinical attributes (medication, diagnosis, and procedure) for patient centric clinical notes.\n\nFor more information, see [Clinical Insights](/clouddocs/clinical_insights_overview/).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"8fa663ea2045c5fda9a14a0b7b017a25","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":205},"frontmatter":{"title":"Overview","excerpt":"Overview.","categories":"Using ACD","slug":"overview","toc":true},"excerpt":"Overview.","exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Overview\"\nexcerpt: \"Overview.\"\ncategories: Using ACD\nslug: overview\ntoc: true\n---\n<!-- ---\n\ncopyright:\n  years: 2020\nlastupdated: \"2020-04-01\"\n\nkeywords: annotator clinical data, clinical data, annotation\n\nsubcollection: wh-acd\n\n--- -->\n\n<!-- # Overview -->\n\n**Notice:** Annotator for Clinical Data Service is currently in Limited Availability.
