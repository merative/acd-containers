The consumer uses the Annotator for Clinical Data Configuration Editor to create a new cartridge (or modify an existing one) and customizes the contents (artifacts) of the cartridge to their domain. After that, the consumer will **Export** the cartridge in order to save a snapshot of the cartridge.\n\n2. The consumer deploys the cartridge snapshot (a zip file) to Annotator for Clinical Data using _POST /v1/cartridges_ API. A successful request for creating a cartridge will return with `HTTP 202 Accepted` response code and will include the path to the resource, e.g., `/v1/cartridges/cartridgeId` in the response body and the response header. The resource path can be used in _GET /v1/cartridges/cartridgeId_ API to obtain the overall deployment status. In the following curl example, the consumer's cartridge file is `/path/to/name_of_cartridge_file.zip`.\n\n```Curl\n\n curl -X POST --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n  --header \"Accept:application/json\" \\\n --header \"Content-Type:application/octet-stream\" \\\n --data-binary @/path/to/name_of_cartridge_file.zip \\\n \"<route_host>/v1/cartridges?version=2019-09-01\"\n\n```\n\nUse the _POST /v1/cartridges_ operation for the initial deployment of a cartridge version and _PUT /v1/cartridges_ to redploy cartridge updates. Different published versions of a cartridge (e.g. cartridge_v1.0, cartridge_v2.0) will need to be initially deployed via the POST operation and subsequently redeployed via the PUT operation.\n\n3. The consumer redeploys a previously deployed cartridge version using the _PUT /v1/cartridges_ API. The cartridge ID is extracted directly from the cartridge zip file. A successful request for updating the cartridge (re)deployment will result in a `HTTP 202 Accepted` response code and will include the path to the resource, e.g., `/v1/cartridges/cartridgeId` in the response body and the response header.\n\n```Curl\n\n curl -X PUT --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n --header \"Accept:application/json\" \\\n --header \"Content-Type:application/octet-stream\" \\\n --data-binary @/path/to/name_of_cartridge_file.zip \\\n \"<route_host>/v1/cartridges?version=2019-09-01\"\n\n```\n\n4. The consumer retrieves a list of deployed cartridges for a given tenant using the _GET /v1/cartridges_ API. An empty list is returned if no cartridges have been deployed.\n\n```Curl\n\n curl -X GET --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n --header \"Accept:application/json\" \\\n \"<route_host>/v1/cartridges?version=2019-09-01\"\n\n```\n\n5. The consumer can view the status of a specific cartridge deployment by invoking the _GET /v1/cartridges/{cartridgeId}_ API with the cartridge ID supplied as a path parameter. If the supplied ID does not exists, then an `HTTP 404 Not Found` response code is returned. The following curl command returns the deployment status of the `cartridge_id`.\n\n```Curl\n\n curl -X GET --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n --header \"Accept:application/json\" \\\n \"<route_host>/v1/cartridges/cartridge_id?version=2019-09-01\"\n\n```\n\nThe _cartridges_ API is the recommended way for a cartridge deployment and is compatible with the legacy _deploy_ API. In many situations, the consumer has already deployed a cartridge using the _deploy_ API and the consumer can immediately update the same cartridge using the above POST and PUT operations on the _cartridges_ API to initially create and to subsequently update the cartridge deployment.\nA typical _POST /v1/cartridges_ operation creates and initializes a deployment for cartridge that has never been deployed to the system. For cartridges that have been previously deployed with the _deploy_ API, the _POST /v1/cartridges_ API will create, initialize, and update an existing cartridge deployment. Subsequent redeployments of a cartridge must use the _PUT /v1/cartridges_ API.\n\n## Legacy cartridge deployment\n\n1. The consumer uses the Annotator for Clinical Data Configuration Editor to create a new cartridge (or modify an existing one) and customizes the contents (artifacts) of the cartridge to their domain. After that, the consumer will **Export** the cartridge in order to save a snapshot of the cartridge.\n2. The consumer deploys the cartridge snapshot (a zip file) to Annotator for Clinical Data using _POST /v1/deploy_ API. In the following curl example, the consumer's cartridge file is `./my_cartridges/name_of_cartridge_file.zip`, and `update=false` means do not update the resource if it already exists. Specify the `update=true` parameter on the _deploy_ API to update an existing cartridge.\n\nA successful cartridge deploy will result in `HTTP 201 Created` if it is a new resource, or `HTTP 200 OK` if `update=true` was specified and the existing resource was updated.\n\n```Curl\ncurl -X POST --header \"Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n--header “Content-Type: application/octet-stream” \\\n--header \"Accept: application/json\" \\\n--data-binary @./my_cartridges/name_of_cartridge_file.zip \\\n\"<route_host>/v1/deploy?update=false&version=2018-01-17\"\n```\n\nSome large cartridge deployments can exceed the request timeout thresholds defined in the data center gateways (usually after 2 mins).
