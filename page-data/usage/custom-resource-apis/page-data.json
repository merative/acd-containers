When a custom resource is created or updated, the desired state (Spec field) is updated and available immediately. Over time, the system will work to bring the Status into line with the Spec. These fields provide a standard way to report the state of the custom resource or ACD service instance.\n\nFor more information on the object spec, status, and metadata, see the [Kubernetes API Conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md).\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Spec</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Status</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Spec\n\n### Properties\n\n| Property | Description | Required | Default |\n|----------|-------------|----------|---------|\n| Annotators | Which annotators are deployed for the instance | Yes | See doc below |\n| Configuration Storage | Persistent volume requests | Yes | See doc below |\n| License | License acceptance and usage | Yes | None |\n| Network Policy | Network security policies | Yes | Enabled |\n| Replicas | Number of replica nodes in the cluster | Yes | 3 |\n| Resources | Resource specifications for instance | No | See doc below |\n| Tenant Header | Unique header for multi-tenancy | No | None |\n| Version | Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition version | Yes | None |\n\n<AnchorLinks small>\n  <AnchorLink>Annotators</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Configuration Storage</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>License</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Network Policy</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Replicas</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Resources</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Tenant Header</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Version</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n### `Annotators`\n\n#### Description\n\nThe `Annotators` property tells the deployment which annotator pods should be created as part of the deployment.  At least one annotator needs to be enabled and by default all annotators are enabled.\n\n- `Advanced Care Insights` : discovers contextual information for problems, procedures, and medications identified in unstructured text\n- `Attribute Detection` : discovers domain specific attributes and associated values to be discovered in unstructured clinical text\n- `Concept Detection` : discovers matching terms from concept dictionaries\n- `Concept Disambiguation` : ranks term revelency based on sentence and document level information\n- `Concept Value Detection` : used with concept detection to discover values for matched dictionary concepts\n- `Hypothetical Detection` : discovers spans of text that are the object of a hypothetical statement\n- `Model Broker`: discovers key clinical concepts, such as medications, diagnoses, and procedures, with contextual scores.\n- `Negation Detection` : discovers  the spans of text that are the object of a negation and also identifies the text that triggered the negation\n- `Ontology` : allows user to manage custom ontologies / dictionaries\n- `Spell Checker` : discovers misspelled words and phrases in a document and suggests corrections\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\n  Annotators:\n    Advanced Care Insights:\n      Enabled:  true\n    Attribute Detection:\n      Enabled:  true\n    Concept Detection:\n      Enabled:  true\n    Concept Disambiguation:\n      Enabled:  true\n    Concept Value Detection:\n      Enabled:  true\n    Hypothetical Detection:\n      Enabled:  true\n    Model Broker:\n      Enabled:  true\n    Negation Detection:\n      Enabled:  true\n    Ontology:\n      Enabled:  true\n    Spell Checker:\n      Enabled:  true\n```\n\n### `Configuration Storage`\n\n#### Description\n\nThe `Configuration Storage` property tells the deployment whether persistent storage is enabled and the type of storage being used.  There are two required fields to configuration storage.\n\n- `Storage` : either File or S3 compatible storage.  \n\n- `File Storage` : whether persistent storage is enabled, default is true.\n\nIf persistent is enabled the following additional properties are available:\n\n#### PVC\n\n- `PVC storage size` : default 10 Gigabytes\n- `Supplemental Group ID` : only needs to be set if root(0) is not being used\n- `Existing PVC name` | name of the persistent volume claim\n- `Storage Class Name` : some storage options require specific storage class names\n\nIf S3 compatible (COS) is enabled these additional properties need to be set:\n\n#### S3 Storage\n\n- `Endpoint URL` : S3 Storage endpoint URL\n- `Location` : cloud region of storage\n- `Bucket` : name the bucket to use for storage\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\n  Configuration Storage:\n    Backend:  file\n    File:\n      Persistent:  true\n      Volume:\n        Existing Claim Name:       /acd-pvc\n        Size:                      10Gi\n        Storage Class Name:        <xxx>\n        Supplemental Group:        \n        Use Dynamic Provisioning:  false\n    s3:\n      Bucket:        \n      Endpoint URL:  \n      Location:\n```\n\n### `License`\n\n#### Description\n\nThe `License` property contains two required field:\n\n- `accept` : must be boolean `true` for the ACD pods to successfully start.\n- `use` : the type of license being used.  Can be one of the following values:\n  - `production`\n  - `development`\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\n  License:\n    Accept:  true\n    Use:     Production\n```\n\n### `Network Policy`\n\n#### Description\n\nThe `Network Policy` property tells the deployment whether network security is enabled.  The default is true.\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\n  Network Policy:\n    Enabled:  true\n    Ingress:\n      From Selectors:\n```\n\n### `Replicas`\n\n#### Description\n\nThe `Replicas` property tells the deployment how many replica pods to create for each annotator. The default is three replicas for each annotator.\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\n  Replicas:            3\n```\n\n### `Resources`\n\n#### Description\n\nThe `Resources` property defines the CPU, ephemeral storage, and memory for limits and requests.\n\n#### CPU\n\nThe default CPU request is 100m.\n\nIt is worth noting that you can only request CPU, there is not a limit field, as the Annotator for Clinical Data operator will set the limits CPU to the requests CPU.\n\n#### Memory\n\nYou are able to set both requests and limits for memory.  The values must follow Kubernetes constraints.\n\n#### Ephemeral Storage\n\nYou are able to set the values for non-persisted or transient storage.  All data created / managed within the ephemeral storage is only present for the lifetime of the pod.  Transient storage should be used as the sole storage mechanism in a production environment.\n\nIf this field is not provided, or parts of the resources object are left unset, the default values(s) will be used for the container.\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\nAPI Version: wh-acd.ibm.com/v1\nName: acd-instance\nKind: Acd\nSpec:\n  Resources:\n    Limits:\n      Cpu:                \n      Ephemeral Storage:  500Mi\n      Memory:             4Gi\n    Requests:\n      Cpu:                100m\n      Ephemeral Storage:  200Mi\n      Memory:             4Gi\n```\n\n### `Tenant Header`\n\n#### Description\n\nThe `Tenant Header` property defines a [header](/planning/tenancy/) to include in a multi-tenant environment to isolate data from other tenants.\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\n  Tenant Header:  <AUTHORIZATION / AUTHENTICATION HEADER>\n```\n\n### `Version`\n\n#### Description\n\nThe `Version` property identifies the build of the operator that is deployed.\n\n#### Example\n\n```yaml\n  Version:  v2.0.202110010226\n```\n\n## Status\n\nThe Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition is a Custom Resource Definition used to deploy and manage an instance of Annotator for Clinical Data service.\n\n### Conditions\n\nThe Annotation for Clinical Data service supports Kubernetes [Conditions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#typical-status-properties). These `Conditions` can be viewed as a snapshot of the current and most up-to-date status of the instance.\n\nThe `Initialized` condition will be set to `True` when all the pods are created for the desired number of replicas set by the instance specification.\n\nThe `Deployed` condition will be set to `InstallSuccessful` when the images for the annotators have been deployed to their respective pods.\n\n#### Example\n\n```\n$ oc get acd\nNAME\t\tINITIALIZED\t    DEPLOYED\t\t\t    VERSION\t\t\t    AGE\nAcd-instance\tTrue\t\tInstallSuccessful\tV2.0.20211001225\t\t5h8m\n\n$ oc describe acd/acd-instance\n...Status:\n  Conditions:\n    Last Transition Time:  2021-10-05T20:38:19Z\n    Status:                True\n    Type:                  Initialized\n    Last Transition Time:  2021-10-05T20:38:24Z\n    Message:               notes\n\n    Reason:  InstallSuccessful\n    Status:  True\n    Type:    Deployed\n```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"bb73bd913f15063d9f2373631015f10b","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":259},"frontmatter":{"title":"ACD Custom Resource","excerpt":"ACD status and spec.","categories":"APIs","slug":"status","toc":true},"excerpt":"ACD status and spec.","exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"ACD Custom Resource\"\nexcerpt: \"ACD status and spec.\"\ncategories: APIs\nslug: status\ntoc: true\n---\n\nThe `Acd` resource is a Custom Resource Definition used to deploy and manage an instance of Annotator for Clinical Data service.\n\nJust as other Kubernetes objects do, the `Acd` custom resource includes two nested object fields that govern the object's configuration: the object `Spec` (desired state) and the object `Status` (current state).
