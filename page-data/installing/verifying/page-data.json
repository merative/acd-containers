(You may have to press enter again to get back to the command prompt.) Note that we used the ampersand (&; a control operator) at the end of the command. The shell assigns a number to the job and displays this job number after a smaller number between brackets. Note the job number returned. Once you are done running the curl command to verify status, you can end the port-forward using that job number.\n\nExample output:\n\n```\n$ oc port-forward ibm-wh-acd-acd-66bc5786-7rrc7 -n acd-test 9443:9443 &\n[1] 93053\n\n```\n\nWith the port-forward process running in the background, call the ACD status API.
