For a development or test environment, 1 or 2 replicas can be configured and 8 CPU/node may be used.  \n\nBy default, the ACD pods may use all of the CPUs on a node. If needed, you can limit the ACD deployment CPU usage (see [Configuration](../../management/configuring)).\n\nThese are the requirements for ACD. The cluster itself has additional requirements for master, infrastructure and possible additional worker node for monitoring, logging and other components or applications being run. Please see the [OpenShift recommended host practices](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/scalability_and_performance/recommended-host-practices.html) for guidance on adding infrastructure nodes and moving resources to those nodes.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"e2acd09fd28f95373255c8c3dbace44a","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":219},"frontmatter":{"title":"Prerequisites","excerpt":"Prerequisites for installing IBM ACD.","categories":"installing","slug":"prerequisites","toc":true},"excerpt":"Prerequisites for installing IBM ACD.","exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Prerequisites\"\nexcerpt: \"Prerequisites for installing IBM ACD.\"\ncategories: installing\nslug: prerequisites\ntoc: true\n---\n\nAnnotator for Clinical Data (ACD) Container Edition has the following prerequisites:\n\n- Red Hat Openshift Container Platform (OCP) 4.7 or later\n  - Commencing with OpenShift Container Platform 4.8, Red Hat will denote all even numbered minor releases (eg 4.8, 4.10, 4.12) as Extended Update Support (EUS) releases.
