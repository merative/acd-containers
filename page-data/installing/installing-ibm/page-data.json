All Annotator for Clinical Data (ACD) Container Edition consumers will need to migrate their ACD instances from IBM Watson ACD to Merative ACD by March 31, 2023._\n\n_The following instructions are for installing IBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition. For installation instructions for Merative Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition, please refer [here](/installing/installing/)._\n\nTo install IBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition, you may use either the OpenShift Container Platform web console, the [oc](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/welcome/index.html) command line utility, or the [cloudctl](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak-cli) command line utility.\n\n## Overview\n\nAnnotator for Clinical Data Container Edition is an [operator-based](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) release and uses a custom resource to define your ACD configuration.\n\nThe ACD operator uses the custom resource to deploy and manage the entire lifecycle of each ACD instance. Custom resources are presented as YAML configuration documents that define instances of the `Acd` custom resource type.\n\nInstalling ACD has three phases:\n\n1. Install the IBM operator catalog:  This will deploy the catalog from which IBM operators, including ACD, can be installed.\n1. Install the ACD operator:  This will deploy the operator that can be used to install and manage your ACD instances.\n1. Install one or more replicas of ACD by using the ACD operator.\n\n## Before you begin\n\n- [Plan for your installation](/planning/namespace/), such as preparing for persistent storage, considering security options, and planning for performance and capacity.\n- [Obtain an entitlement key](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) and [verify registry access](/installing/installing-ibm/#verifying-ibm-entitled-registry-access) to the IBM Entitled Registry. Note that customers must use their IBMid to log in to their `myibm` account. The customer must request the entitlement key so the ownership and management of the entitlement stays with them.\n- Set up your environment according to the [prerequisites](/installing/prereqs/), including setting up your OpenShift Container Platform.\n- Obtain the connection details for your OpenShift Container Platform cluster from your administrator.\n- [Set up](/installing/setup-namespace/) your project and project dependencies if required for your environment. If using the CLI to install the ACD operator and ACD service, you will need the [cloudctl](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak-cli) command line utility.\n\n## Verifying IBM Entitled Registry access\n\nA pull secret consists of a username and password used to authenticate the user with the container registry to ensure the user is entitled to pull images. When an entitlement key is obtained from `myibm`, the username should be `cp` and the password should be the entitlement key.\n\nBefore setting up the pull secret, verify the entitlement key can access the entitled registry.\n\nExample (Docker with IBM Entitled Registry entitlement key):\n\n```\ndocker login cp.icr.io --username cp --password <your entitlement key>\n```\n\n## Air-gapped (disconnected) installation\n\nSome environments are disconnected and do not have access to the public internet, and therefore no access to DockerHub or other image registries. When deploying in an air-gapped environment, refer to the [Air-gap Installation](/installing/air-gap-installation/).\n\n## Non air-gapped (connected) installation\n\nWhen deploying in a non air-gapped or connected environment, continue with the following installation. These installation steps require internet access to pull images from the image registries.\n\n### IBM Entitled Registry pull secret\n\nIn order for ACD images to be pulled from the IBM Entitled Registry, a pull secret must be added to the environment. This can be set up using one of the following:\n\n1. Added to the OpenShift global pull secrets\n1. Added to the ACD operand service account\n\n#### Option 1: OpenShift global pull secret installation\n\nAdd the pull secret to the OpenShift global pull secret via the OpenShift web console or oc command line.\n\nAdding a global pull secret using the OpenShift web console. This method is much less error prone.\n\n1. Use the RedHat OpenShift Container Platform web console and select `Workloads -> Secrets` in the `openshift-config` project.\n\n1. Select the `pull-secret` object from the list of secrets.\n\n1. Select `Actions -> Edit Secret` to bring up the secret editor for this secret.\n\n1. Edit an existing credential for your registry if it already exists or Select `Add credentials` at the bottom and fill in the new pull secret credentials.\n\n   ![Example Pull Secret](../../images/ibm-pull-secret-example.png)\n\nAdding a global pull secret using the oc command line:\n\n1. Extract the current global image pull secret from the cluster into a file in the current directory named `.dockerconfigjson`:\n\n   `oc extract secret/pull-secret --namespace openshift-config --to=.`\n\n1. Create a base64 encoded string with the registry userid and password as it aligns with your access method.\n\n   `printf \"cp:<acd registry key>\" | base64`\n\n1. Edit the `.dockerconfigjson` file and **ADD** a new JSON object to the existing auths object with the credentials for the IBM Entitled Registry. For example:\n\n   ```\n   \"cp.icr.io\": {\n       \"auth\": \"aWFtYXBpaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcGFzc3dvcmQ=\",\n       \"email\": \"xxx@nomail.relay.ibm.com\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n1. Update the global image pull secret with the updated credentials:\n\n   `oc set data secret/pull-secret --namespace openshift-config --from-file=.dockerconfigjson`\n\n1. Monitor the node status using the command:\n\n   `oc get nodes`\n\n1. When the nodes are finished restarting, your cluster is now ready to pull images from the registry.\n\nFor more information on OpenShift pull secrets, refer to [Using image pull secrets](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html#images-update-global-pull-secret_using-image-pull-secrets).\n\n#### Option 2: Service account pull secret installation\n\nTo add the pull secret to individual ACD operand service accounts:\n\n1. Create a secret\n\n   ```\n   kubectl create secret docker-registry ibm-entitlement-key \\\n       --docker-server=cp.icr.io \\\n       --docker-username=<username> \\\n       --docker-password=<password> \\\n       --docker-email=<email_address> \\\n       --namespace=<namespace>\n   ```\n\n   - `<username>` is the username for the entitled registry. This should be `cp` when using a `myibm` entitlement key.\n   - `<password>` is the password for the entitled registry. This should be the entitlement key from `myibm`.\n\n1. After the ACD operand has been installed, the service account must be patched to point to the secret.\n\n  NOTE: If using the current release of the ACD Container Edition, this `ibm-entitlement-key` pull secret is already defined in the operand service account so the patch step is no longer necessary.\n\n   ```\n   kubectl patch serviceaccount ibm-wh-acd-operand \\\n       --namespace <namespace> \\\n       --patch '{\"imagePullSecrets\": [{\"name\": \"ibm-entitlement-key\"}]}'\n   ```\n\n1. Then the ACD operand pods must be restarted\n\n   ```\n   kubectl delete pods \\\n       --namespace <namespace> \\\n       --all\n   ```\n\n## Installing the IBM operator catalog\n\nBefore you can install the ACD operator and use it to create instances of the ACD service, you must have a catalog source which includes ACD. ACD is available with the IBM operator catalog.\n\nIf you have other IBM products installed in your cluster, then you may already have the IBM operator catalog available, and you can continue to installing the ACD operator from there.\n\n**Important**: If you operate in an internet-connected Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, you must migrate your images from Docker to the IBM Container Registry by 30 September 2021. IBM operator catalog related images can be sourced from `icr.io/cpopen`. Refer to [Migrating from Docker to IBM Container Registry](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/1.0?topic=clusters-migrating-from-docker-container-registry) for more details.\n\nTo add the IBM operator catalog:\n\n1. Create a file for the IBM operator catalog source with the following content, and save as `IBMCatalogSource.yaml`:\n\n   ```yaml IBMCatalogSource.yaml\n   apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1\n   kind: CatalogSource\n   metadata:\n      name: ibm-operator-catalog\n      namespace: openshift-marketplace\n   spec:\n      displayName: \"IBM Operator Catalog\"\n      publisher: IBM\n      sourceType: grpc\n      image: icr.io/cpopen/ibm-operator-catalog\n      updateStrategy:\n        registryPoll:\n          interval: 45m\n   ```\n\n1. Log in to your Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as a cluster administrator by using the `oc` CLI.\n\n1. Apply the source by using the following command:\n\n   `oc apply -f IBMCatalogSource.yaml`\n\nThe IBM operator catalog source is added to the OperatorHub catalog, making the ACD operator available to install.\n\nMore information on the IBM operator catalog can be found at [Red Hat Catalog Enablement for the IBM operator catalog](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak/blob/master/reference/operator-catalog-enablement.md)\n\n## Installing the ACD operator\n\n### Install the ACD operator using the web console\n\nTo install the ACD operator through the OpenShift Container Platform web console, do the following:\n\n1. Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform [web console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/web_console/web-console.html) using your login credentials.\n1. Expand the **Operators** dropdown and select **OperatorHub** to open the **OperatorHub** dashboard.\n1. Select the project you want to use as the target namespace for your ACD deployment.\n1. In the **All Items** search box enter `ACD` to locate the operator title.\n1. Click the **ACD** tile to open the install side panel.\n1. Click the **Install** button to open the **Create Operator Subscription** dashboard.\n1. Select the chosen installation mode that suits your requirements. If the installation mode is **A specific namespace on the cluster**, select the target namespace you created previously.\n1. Select the approval strategy that suits your requirements. If set to **Automatic**, the [Subscription](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.html#olm-subscription_olm-understanding-olm) resource uses [Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.html#olm-overview_olm-understanding-olm) to manage and upgrade the operator to ensure that the latest version is always running in the cluster. With **Manual** approval set, a project administrator must manually approve the install plan to enable the upgrade. See the [upgrading](../../installing/upgrading) section for more details.\n1. Click **Install** to begin the installation.\n\nThe installation can take a few minutes to complete.\n\n### Install the ACD operator using cloudctl\n\n```\ncloudctl case launch \\\n    --case case/ibm-wh-acd \\\n    --namespace <namespace> \\\n    --inventory clinicalDataAnnotatorOperatorSetup \\\n    --action installOperator \\\n    --tolerance 1\n```\n\n## Installing the ACD service\n\nInstances of ACD can be created after the ACD operator is installed.\n\nIf the ACD operator was installed into a specific namespace, then it can only be used to manage instances of ACD in that namespace.\n\nIf the ACD operator was installed for all namespaces, then it can be used to manage instances of ACD in any namespace, including those created after the ACD operator was deployed.\n\nWhen installing an instance of ACD, ensure you are using a namespace that an ACD operator is managing.\n\n### Install the ACD service by using the web console\n\nTo install the ACD service through the OpenShift Container Platform web console, do the following:\n\n1. Log in to the OpenShift Container Platform [web console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/web_console/web-console.html) using your login credentials.\n1. Expand the **Operators** dropdown and select **Installed Operators** to open the **Installed Operators** page.\n1. Expand the **Project** dropdown and select the project the operator is installed in. Select the **Annotator for Clinical Data** operator link in the **Name** column. If the operator is not shown, it is either not installed or not available for the selected namespace.\n1. In the **Operator Details** dashboard, click the **Annotator for Clinical Data** tab.\n1. Click the **Create Acd** button to open the **Create Acd** panel. You can use this panel to define an `Acd` custom resource.\n    - From here, you can install by using the [Form view](/management/configuring/#form-view). For more advanced configurations or to install an instance using default configuration, see installing by using the [YAML view](/management/configuring/#yaml-view).\n\n### Install the ACD service using cloudctl\n\nBy default, this will deploy 3 replicas of ACD. Include `--args \"--replicas 1\"` to install a 1 replica ACD instance.\n\n```\ncloudctl case launch \\\n    --case case/ibm-wh-acd \\\n    --namespace <namespace> \\\n    --inventory clinicalDataAnnotatorOperator \\\n    --action applyCustomResources \\\n    --tolerance 1\n```\n\nTo install with object storage, the following parameters need to be added.\n\n```\ncloudctl case launch \\\n    --case case/ibm-wh-acd \\\n    --namespace <namespace> \\\n    --inventory clinicalDataAnnotatorOperator \\\n    --action applyCustomResources \\\n    --tolerance 1 \\\n    --args \"--backend cos --bucket <bucket> --endpointUrl <endpoint> --location <location>\"\n```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"0e32bd6f5cb68dae29a32d1132425e0d","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":224},"frontmatter":{"title":"Installing IBM Watson ACD","excerpt":"Installing IBM Watson ACD.","categories":"installing","slug":"installing","toc":true},"excerpt":"Installing IBM Watson ACD.","exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Installing IBM Watson ACD\"\nexcerpt: \"Installing IBM Watson ACD.\"\ncategories: installing\nslug: installing\ntoc: true\n---\n<!--                                                                    -->\n<!-- (C) Copyright Merative US L.P. and others 2018, 2023                -->\n<!--                                                                    -->\n<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0                                -->\n<!--                                                                    -->\n\n\n_Note: The Merative Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition is the replacement for the IBM Watson Annotator for Clinical Data Container Edition.
