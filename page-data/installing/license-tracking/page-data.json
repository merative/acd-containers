License usage is based on a Virtual Processor Core (VPC) metric. For ACD, it is the top-level pod `merative-acd-acd` that will be metered for VPC usage. The usage will be the capacity of the node where this pod runs. For example, ACD running in a cluster with 16 CPU/node has license usage = 16 VPC. The ACD CPU limit can be adjusted by the number of replicas configured and the size of the nodes where ACD runs. For more information on configuration, see [Configuration](/management/configuring/).\n\nACD license use types include:\n  - `Development` for non-production use of ACD in a development or test environment\n  - `Production` for installations of ACD running in a production environment\n  - `ConfigurationEditor` for an installation of ACD running as a sandbox instance for the <span><a aria-current=\"\" to=\"https://merative.github.io/acd-containers/configeditor/index.html#openshift-overview\" href=\"https://merative.github.io/acd-containers/configeditor/index.html#openshift-overview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"LeftNav-module--outboundLink\">Configuration Editor</a><svg focusable=\"false\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMidYMid meet\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"currentColor\" width=\"14\" height=\"14\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path d=\"M13,14H3c-0.6,0-1-0.4-1-1V3c0-0.6,0.4-1,1-1h5v1H3v10h10V8h1v5C14,13.6,13.6,14,13,14z\"></path><path d=\"M10 1L10 2 13.3 2 9 6.3 9.7 7 14 2.7 14 6 15 6 15 1z\"></path></svg></span>\n\nAs a required prerequisite for the Configuration Editor, an ACD installation with the license use type of `ConfigurationEditor` does not apply its metrics towards the purchased virtual processor core (VPC) licenses.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe IBM License Service collects and stores the license usage information which can be used for audit purposes and for tracking license consumption at the cluster level.\nThe solution works in the background and does not require any configuration.\nOnly one instance of the License Service is deployed per cluster.\n\nReview [Validating if License Service is deployed on the cluster](#validating-if-license-service-is-deployed-on-the-cluster),\nand use the License Service APIs to generate usage audit reports (see [License Service](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cpfs?topic=license-service) documentation).\n\n## Deploying License Service\n\nIf [Validating if License Service is deployed on the cluster](#validating-if-license-service-is-deployed-on-the-cluster) determines that the License Service is not deployed on the cluster where you have deployed ACD,\nor the License Service does not return a status of Running, refer to the information about License Service, including how to install, retrieve license usage data, and troubleshoot.\nSee the [License Service](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cpfs?topic=license-service) documentation.\n\nIf deploying the License Service to a disconnected or air-gapped cluster, see the [offline installation License Service](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cpfs?topic=software-offline-installation).\n\n## Validating if License Service is deployed on the cluster\n\nTo ensure license reporting continuity, make sure that License Service is successfully deployed.\nIt is recommended to periodically verify whether it is active.\n\nTo validate whether License Service is deployed and running on the cluster, log into the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster and run the following command:\n\n```bash\noc get pods --all-namespaces | grep ibm-licensing | grep -v operator\n```\n\nThe following response is a confirmation of successful deployment:\n\n```bash\n1/1     Running\n```\n\n## Viewing license usage\n\nThe License Service is accessible via the ```ibm-licensing-service-instance``` route that is created as part of the License Service setup.\n\n![ibm-licensing-service-instance](../../images/license_route.png)\n\nIn order to run the report, the ```ibm-licensing-token``` secret's [token](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cpfs?topic=authentication-license-service-api-token#obtaining) must be retrieved and provided on the above service.
